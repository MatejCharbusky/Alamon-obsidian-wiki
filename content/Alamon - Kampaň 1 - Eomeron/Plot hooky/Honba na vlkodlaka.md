Týpek, co je vlkodlak je dohnán lovcem a hráči budou mít příležitost ho buď zachránit, nebo zabít. Celkem morální dilema.

Člověk, který se stal vlkodlakem před několika měsíci, byl objeven autoritami a dal se na útěk. Autority na něj vypsali odměnu a najmuli si lovce netvorů. 
On nechce nikomu ublížit, ale nechce se nechat zabít, dokud se ho nepokusí hráči zachránit. Uvědomí si, že než by někdo objevil lék na lykantropii, spoustě lidí bude ublíženo jeho rukou a bude schopný přijmout svůj osud.

Hráči budou mít možnost ho buď zkusit zachránit, či zabít a žít se svým rozhodnutím.

## Struktura
Note that the following structure is based on Freytag's pyramid. Many authors might find this methodology defunct, but in truth most stories use a variation of it. Working with World Anvil has the benefit that you can nest plots within other plots - allowing you various rises and falls within your plot flow. That means that each individual "plot" might include all, any, or none of these structures (for example, you might skip the conclusion phase and drive straight into another rising action sequence). The rest of the tabs can provide you with a complimentary OR replacement method of organization. As always, everything is optional
#### Expozice
The exposition is the portion of a story that introduces important background information to the audience; for example, information about the setting, events occurring before the main plot, characterisation and back stories, etc. Exposition can be conveyed through dialogue, flashbacks, character's thoughts, background details, in-universe media, or the narrator telling a back-story
#### Konflikt
Conflict is part of the pyramid which is sometimes ommited or merged within the introduction and/or rising action. The conflict defines the pressure points, the stressors which propel the story forward and drive your protagonists to act.
#### Stoupající akce
In the rising action, a series of events build toward the point of greatest interest. The rising action of a story is the series of events that begin immediately after the exposition (introduction) of the story and builds up to the climax. These events are generally the most important parts of the story, since the entire plot depends on them to set up the climax and, ultimately, to create the satisfactory resolution of the story itself.
#### Vyvrcholení
The climax is the turning point, which changes the protagonist's fate. If the story is a comedy and things were going badly for the protagonist, the plot will begin to unfold in their favor, often requiring the protagonist to draw on hidden inner strengths. If the story is a tragedy, the opposite state of affairs will ensue, with things going from good to bad for the protagonist, often revealing the protagonist's hidden weaknesses
#### Klesající akce
During the falling action, the conflict between the protagonist and the antagonist unravels, with the protagonist winning or losing against the antagonist. The falling action may contain a moment of final suspense, in which the final outcome of the conflict is in doubt.
#### Rozuzlení
The conclusion is the end of the story, sometimes called dénouement, resolution, or catastrophe. If at the end of the story the protagonist achieves his goal, the story is a comedy; however, if the protagonist fails, the story is a tragedy. After conflicts are resolved, the characters resume their normal lives. The conclusion makes way for the catharsis - an event or events allowing the tension or anxiety to loosen. The denouement is an event that happened before or after the conclusion or is simply explained as untying the complexities of the plot. The conclusion is found at the lowest right side of the pyramid following the falling action. It is the beginning of another act/scene and punctuated as distinct from the other parts of the dramatic structure.

## Komponenty
Contrary to Freytag's Pyramid, the components panel focuses on breaking your story down to its building blocks. It is more of an internal dialogue than an outline of the story as it will be moving. This methodology is commonly used by storytellers with more open ended action to supplament their "possible-to-happen" structure. It's about understanding the "whos", "whys", and "whats" of your story.

#### Cíle
Goals describe what the intended resolution of your protagonists is - their motivation. It can be one thing or ten, but a goal must have a solid reason behind it. This can be anything from a reward (monetary or otherwise), to more complex goals like saving your long lost love from the jaws of death.
#### Hooks
Hooks, as the name denotes, are pieces of action or knowledge which aim to nudge the protagonists into action - glimpses of hidden truths, dangling carrots for the donkeys to follow. Hooks can be presented as clear as day or can be used subversively to change the undestanding of your protagonists during a longer period of time.
#### Stakes
Stakes are counters to hooks. They aim to add to the drama and substantiate the goals. Stakes describe what should happen if a goal is not reached. They instill the fear of failure and should be balanced againsts the potential gains.
#### Morální dilema
Moral quandaries are obstacles which oppose the moral sensibilities and understanding of the protagonists. Their aim is, as with stakes, to burden and make the protagonists question their goals. Overcoming a moral quandary is an important step towards a deeper understanding of a protagonist's character. Think of the convictions of your protagonists and set dilemmas for them to work through. For example, does the life of a single loved one out-weight the life of many strangers?
#### Kruté triky
Cruel tricks are events that the protagonists will suffer through. Contrary to moral quandaries and stakes, cruel tricks have nothing to do with the protagonist specifically. Cruel tricks are the manifestation of the fact that, mostly, the heroes have no control over the world. In many ways, it is a practice in humility and builds the protagonist's character forcefully. A common cruel trick to find out that you have been working for the evil side all along and you had no way to know it, until now - So now what? Another example might be for a hero to go on a journey in order to find a potion to heal the village, only to find on his return that everyone was murdered by bandits.
#### Odrazení
A red herring is a kind of fallacy, an irrelevant topic introduced to divert the attention of listeners or readers from the original issue. In literature, this fallacy is often used in detective or suspense novels to mislead readers or characters, or to induce them to make false conclusions. The red herring of your plot is the decoy. The thing that your protagonists will believe to be true only to discover it was all a sham aimed to make them lose time and dishearten them. For example, a footprint outside the window of a crimescene was in fact made by a passing drunk, and not the criminal.
